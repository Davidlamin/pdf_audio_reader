This PDF to Audio application, built using Tkinter, PyPDF2, and pyttsx3, allows users to convert PDF text to speech. Users can select a PDF file, adjust the speech rate, and choose between male and female voices. The application features a graphical user interface with buttons to select a PDF, set speech parameters, play the extracted text as audio, and stop the playback. To use the application, install Python 3.x, Tkinter, PyPDF2, and pyttsx3.
 Run the script to launch the GUI, choose a PDF file, 
set the desired speech rate and voice, and click "Play PDF File" to hear the content. The project is licensed under the MIT License.
